--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Download and install the PostgreSQL database (e.g., PostgreSQL 9.6).
   Or run the "docker-compose.yml" from the root of the project
   (if you have docker installed locally):

2) (Once only) create the PetClinic database and user by executing the "db/postgres/user.sql"
   scripts. You can connect to the database running in the docker container using 
   `psql -U postgres -h localhost -d postgres`, but you don't need to run the script there
   because the petclinic user is already set up if you use the provided `docker-compose.yaml`.

3) Run the app with `spring.profiles.active=postgres` (e.g. as a System property via the command
   line, but any way that sets that property in a Spring Boot app should work).

N.B. the "petclinic" database has to exist for the app to work with the JDBC URL value
as it is configured by default. This condition is taken care of automatically by the 
docker-compose configuration provided, or by the `user.sql` script if you run that as
root.
